# Exygy Assessment

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and Typescript.

The main entry point for the application is in `Listings.tsx`. Individual components live in the `components` folder and each component's styles live in a similarly named file in the same folder. Global styles and shared theming variables live in the `global.scss` file.

Two simple tests for the `Listings` component have been written that just ensures some simple text is present in the document.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
